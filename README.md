Crystal Collector :crystal_ball:

You will be given a random number at the start of the game. Your score will start at zero. It is your objective to make your score match the given number without going over.

When the game starts the four crystals below will be given different values assigned at random. Clicking the crystals will add points to your score. Only by clicking the crystals will you be able to ascertain what value they will add to your score.

If you match the number you win. If you go over you lose. When you win or lose the game will reset. When the game resets the random number will change, and so will the values of each crystal.
